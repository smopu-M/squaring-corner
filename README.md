# SQUARING CORNER
Change to Rounded window to square in Windows 11.
  
This is a software to restore rounded windows to square in Windows 11.  It is useful when the bottom left or right edge of a window is obscured by rounded corners.
  
When launched, the software resides in the task tray, and pressing a set hotkey can change the current active window from rounded corners to squares.
  
It can also be reversed back to rounded corners (set to Ctrl + Shift +F12 by default).
  
If you check the "Enable Small rounded corners" checkbox on the context menu, the window will become small rounded corners when you press the set hotkey.
  
It is possible to change to a different hotkey from the task tray context menu hotkey settings.
  
You can also specify /nomsg from the command line or check the "Don't show message" checkbox in the context menu of the task tray to prevent messages from appearing when changing window corners.

The display languages supported are English, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean.

This software is developed with Hot Soup Processor.
